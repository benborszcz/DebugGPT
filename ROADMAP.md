# Roadmap

DebugGPT aims to become a comprehensive debugging tool that can handle multiple programming languages and interact with the system to perform tasks like installing necessary packages or searching the web for solutions. Here are the main milestones we believe will significantly enhance DebugGPT's capabilities:

- Support for multiple programming languages
- Incorporating human input for complex problem-solving
- Enabling system-level interactions
- Web search capabilities for solutions and necessary downloads
- Speed optimization

## Steps to achieve our roadmap

- [ ] Support for multiple programming languages
  - [ ] Extend the error analysis and code modification capabilities to JavaScript
  - [ ] Extend the error analysis and code modification capabilities to Java
  - [ ] Extend the error analysis and code modification capabilities to other popular languages
- [ ] Incorporating human input for complex problem-solving
  - [ ] Develop a mechanism to incorporate user input during the debugging process
  - [ ] Create a feedback loop where the user can verify and correct the steps proposed by DebugGPT
- [ ] Enabling system-level interactions
  - [ ] Develop capabilities for DebugGPT to interact with the terminal to perform tasks like installing packages
  - [ ] Enable DebugGPT to create, delete, and move files as necessary during the debugging process
- [ ] Web search capabilities for solutions and necessary downloads
  - [ ] Develop a mechanism for DebugGPT to search the web for solutions to complex problems
  - [ ] Enable DebugGPT to download necessary packages or files from the web
- [ ] Speed optimization
  - [ ] Optimize the debugging process to reduce the time taken to debug scripts
  - [ ] Implement caching and other performance-enhancing techniques to speed up DebugGPT
